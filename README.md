Project Goal:
To develop a Chrome extension designed to streamline the process of copying responses from web-based Large Language Model (LLM) chat interfaces.
Triggering Mechanism:
The extension is activated when a user types a query on an LLM chat page and presses the Enter key.
Core Functionality:
Dynamic Content Monitoring: After the Enter key is pressed, the extension begins to monitor the page's Document Object Model (DOM) for changes to identify the new content generated by the LLM.
Intelligent Completion Detection: Recognizing that LLM responses are streamed (appearing word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence), the extension requires an intelligent mechanism to determine when the response is fully generated. The implemented solution is to use a "debounce" technique: the extension waits for a short, quiet period (e.g., 1 second) with no new text appearing. If this quiet period occurs, it concludes that the LLM's response is complete.
Automatic Copy to Clipboard: Once the extension confirms that the entire response has been generated, it automatically copies the full text of this new content to the user's clipboard for immediate use.
